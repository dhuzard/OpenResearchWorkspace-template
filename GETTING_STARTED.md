# Getting started with OpenResearchWorkspace

**A click-by-click guide for researchers who do not code and have little or no GitHub experience.**

You do **not** need to:

- program;
- install Git;
- use a terminal or command line;
- edit YAML or other configuration files;
- understand branches, commits, pull requests, or GitHub Actions;
- install the ORW Python package.

The normal beginner workflow is:

```text
Create my project
      ↓
Fill in a short setup form
      ↓
ORW creates the research structure
      ↓
Add collaborators and research files
      ↓
Work normally
```

> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub template/setup workflow is currently being migrated from the ORW development repository into this dedicated template repository. This guide documents the intended researcher workflow. If the **Set up my research project** button or form is not yet present, the migration is not complete; do not try to reproduce the setup manually.

## Before you begin

You need only:

1. a GitHub account;
2. a short name for your research project;
3. the title of your first study;
4. an idea of what you will measure first;
5. a high-level description of where your authoritative/raw data are stored.

An ORCID is useful but optional.

### Four GitHub words you may see

GitHub uses software-development vocabulary. For the beginner ORW workflow, you can translate it as follows:

| GitHub says | For this guide, think |
| --- | --- |
| **Repository** | Your research project's online workspace |
| **Issue** | A form or discussion page; ORW uses one as the project setup form |
| **Commit** | A saved change with history |
| **GitHub Actions** | Background automation used by ORW; you normally do not open it |

You do not need to learn Git itself to follow this workflow.

---

## Step 1 — Open the ORW template

Open this repository:

[**OpenResearchWorkspace-template**](https://github.com/dhuzard/OpenResearchWorkspace-template)

Check that the repository name at the top is:

```text
dhuzard / OpenResearchWorkspace-template
```

Do **not** create your research project from `dhuzard/OpenResearchWorkspace`. That other repository is where ORW itself is developed.

**Success check:** you are viewing `OpenResearchWorkspace-template`.

---

## Step 2 — Create your own project

1. Click **Use this template** near the top-right of the repository.
2. Choose **Create a new repository**.
3. Choose the GitHub account or organization that should own the project.
4. Enter a short repository name, for example:

```text
light-exposure-mouse-activity
```

5. For ongoing or unpublished research, choose **Private** unless your team has explicitly decided the project should already be public.
6. Click **Create repository**.

GitHub now creates a new project under **your** account or organization. The new project is independent from the ORW template.

**Success check:** the repository name at the top is now your project name, not `OpenResearchWorkspace-template`.

---

## Step 3 — Set up the research project

Your new repository initially contains a generic ORW workspace. The setup form turns it into your actual research project.

On the main page of **your new repository**, click:

**Set up my research project**

If the direct button is unavailable but the setup workflow has already been migrated, you can alternatively open:

**Issues → New issue → Set up my research project**

> GitHub calls this an **issue**, but you can treat it simply as a form. You do not need to understand GitHub issue tracking.

---

## Step 4 — Fill in the setup form

The form should ask for information such as:

- **Project title** — the human-readable title of the overall project;
- **Project description** — one or two sentences explaining the purpose;
- **Researcher name** — how your name should appear in project metadata;
- **First Study** — the first experimental or observational study in the project;
- **First Assay / measurement** — what you will measure first, for example behaviour, imaging, electrophysiology, sequencing, or another measurement type;
- **Data location** — where the authoritative/raw data are stored;
- **Data access level** — for example private, restricted, embargoed, open, or unknown;
- **Keywords** — optional;
- **ORCID** — optional.

Example:

```text
Project title:
Effects of light exposure on mouse activity

Description:
Study of how altered light exposure affects spontaneous mouse activity.

Researcher:
Jane Researcher

First Study:
Light exposure study

First measurement:
Behaviour

Authoritative/raw data location:
Institutional research server

Data access:
Private
```

### Do not put secrets in the setup form

Do not enter:

- passwords;
- API keys or access tokens;
- confidential participant identifiers;
- patient-identifying information;
- authentication credentials;
- information that your institution prohibits from being stored on GitHub.

Use a **high-level data location** such as `Institutional secure server`, not a password or secret access URL.

---

## Step 5 — Submit the setup form

1. Review the information you entered.
2. Tick any confirmation box shown by the form.
3. Click **Create** or **Submit new issue**. GitHub may use either wording.

ORW then runs the initialization automatically.

You should not need to:

- open GitHub Actions;
- edit `.research/project.yml`;
- run a script;
- use a command line.

When initialization succeeds, the setup page should provide a link back to the initialized workspace.

**Success check:** your project README shows your project information and a `studies/` folder exists.

---

## Step 6 — Understand the scientific structure

ORW uses the ISA scientific hierarchy:

```text
Investigation
└── Study
    └── Assay
```

In ordinary language:

- **Investigation** = your overall research project;
- **Study** = one study/design within the project;
- **Assay** = one measurement or test within a Study.

For example:

```text
Effects of light exposure on mouse activity     ← Investigation
└── Light exposure study                        ← Study
    └── Behaviour                               ← Assay
```

An initialized workspace will look approximately like:

```text
your-project/
├── README.md
├── studies/
│   └── your-first-study/
│       ├── data/
│       ├── protocols/
│       ├── analysis/
│       ├── results/
│       └── assays/
│           └── your-first-assay/
├── references/
├── project-docs/
└── .research/
```

You can normally ignore `.research/`. It contains machine-readable metadata used by ORW.

---

## Step 7 — Add a normal research file without using Git

You can upload a small file entirely through the GitHub website:

1. Open the folder where the file belongs.
2. Click **Add file**.
3. Click **Upload files**.
4. Drag the file into the page or select it from your computer.
5. Follow GitHub's save/commit controls to save the change.

If GitHub uses the word **commit**, think **save this version**.

Suitable examples include:

- protocols;
- analysis scripts or notebooks;
- documentation;
- figures;
- small non-sensitive research artifacts;
- references or supporting documents when licensing permits.

---

## Step 8 — Do not treat GitHub as the default raw-data store

ORW can describe and reference data without requiring the data themselves to be stored in GitHub.

Large, sensitive, regulated, confidential, or discipline-specific datasets should normally remain in an appropriate system such as:

- institutional research storage;
- a secure institutional server;
- a discipline-specific repository;
- an archival repository;
- another storage system approved for the data type.

Record where the authoritative data live rather than copying them into GitHub without a reason.

This distinction matters: **the ORW workspace organizes the research project; it does not require every research byte to live inside the repository.**

---

## Step 9 — Invite a collaborator

For a private repository:

1. Open your project repository.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Find the repository access or collaborator section.
4. Choose the option to add a collaborator or person.
5. Search for their GitHub account.
6. Send the invitation.

They must accept the invitation before they can access a private project.

If the project belongs to an institutional GitHub organization, your organization may control who can invite collaborators.

---

## Step 10 — Work normally

At this point, the important mental model is scientific rather than technical:

```text
Project
├── Study 1
│   ├── Assay A
│   └── Assay B
└── Study 2
    └── Assay A
```

Add research material at the level where it belongs. ORW's structured metadata and validation machinery should remain mostly behind the scenes.

You do not need to edit machine-readable metadata during ordinary day-to-day work unless you specifically want to.

---

## If something goes wrong

### I cannot see **Use this template**

Confirm that you are viewing `dhuzard/OpenResearchWorkspace-template`. If the repository has not yet been configured as a GitHub template, the migration is still incomplete.

### I cannot see **Set up my research project**

Confirm that you are looking at the repository you created from this template, not the ORW development repository. During the current repository split, the setup workflow may also still be awaiting migration.

### The setup form was submitted but initialization failed

Do not edit `.research/` or GitHub workflow files to try to repair the project manually. Keep the failure message or link and report it to the repository owner or ORW maintainers.

### I submitted setup twice

ORW should refuse to silently reinitialize an already initialized workspace. The existing project should remain the source of truth.

### My institution does not allow GitHub Actions

The GitHub template path relies on GitHub automation for initialization. If institutional policy prevents that workflow, use another ORW creation path from the canonical project, such as the browser generator, once appropriate for your context.

---

## What you should not need to learn

A successful beginner workflow should **not** require you to learn:

```text
git clone
git add
git commit
git push
branches
pull requests
YAML
JSON Schema
Python packaging
GitHub Actions
RO-Crate internals
```

Those technologies may exist underneath ORW, but they are implementation details rather than prerequisites for managing a research project.

---

## One-page checklist

- [ ] I created the project from **OpenResearchWorkspace-template**, not the development repository.
- [ ] I chose an appropriate visibility setting, usually **Private** for active unpublished work.
- [ ] I completed the **Set up my research project** form.
- [ ] My README shows my own project information.
- [ ] I can identify my first Study and Assay.
- [ ] I know where my authoritative/raw data live.
- [ ] I did not put passwords, credentials, or sensitive participant information in the setup form.
- [ ] I can upload an ordinary project file through the GitHub website.
- [ ] I know how to invite a collaborator if needed.

Once those points are true, you can use the workspace without learning Git or programming.

---

## ORW itself versus this template

This repository is deliberately minimal. The ORW software, specification, schemas, CLI, browser generator, validation logic, FAIR/RO-Crate support, tests, and future agent/MCP integrations are developed in:

[`dhuzard/OpenResearchWorkspace`](https://github.com/dhuzard/OpenResearchWorkspace)

You normally do not need that repository to use this template as a researcher.
